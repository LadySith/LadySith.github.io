Personal Website and Blog
===================

It's up! Also it pretty much looks just like the mockup. Yes it's simple. But that's a great starting point. Currently I don't have my resume up here and the 'Blog' button links to my not so impressive Wordpress blog. All this will be taken care of eventually.. or never. idk.

## To do list
1. Cloud animations
2. Create internal blog
3. Add comments
4. Social media click animations
5. Cleanup CSS
6. Update and link resume

## Thanks to these guys for the cool CSS stuff
