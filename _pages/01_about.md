Hello. My name is Sithe and this is my site that I'm trying out. I've always wanted to get into web dev but kept trying to go the 'quick' route with Wordpress and Github Pages layouts. But now that I have the time to explore this in detail and now that I'm on day 27/30 in learning javascript I figured I should make the effort and honestly this isn't as nerve wracking as I thought it would be. it's actually really fun and I wish I did it sooner. So what's next?

 * I'll just work on this in the meantime
 * Not thinking too far ahead okay
